</p>

Voltaire ERC-4337 Bundler has undergone its largest upgrade since its first launch with the support of EntryPoint v0.7, combined with the groundbreaking performance that gives any application near-instant execution. This upgrade makes onboarding your new users more economically feasible, faster, and smoother to maintain.

## EntryPoint v0.7 Support and Multi-EP Architecture

Voltaire v0.1.0a33 now supports multiple EntryPoints, including the newly released EP v0.7. The new EP version brings key upgrades for enhanced gas efficiency, flexibility, and security. On-chain simulation functions have been moved off-chain, and the new `delegateAndRevert()` helper supports networks without state overrides. A 10% penalty for unused gas limits optimizes bundler performance, while redundant postOp calls have been removed to simplify paymaster operations. Additional updates include ERC-165 support, improved gas limit validations, and a streamlined UserOperation structure to reduce calldata use. 

## Ethereum, L2s and Multichain Support

Voltaire is built with a deep understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it highly adaptable for both Layer 1s, such as Ethereum and Polygon, as well as Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum. Currently, Voltaire operates on over 10 different networks, and it continues to expand as demand for new scaling solutions grows.

## Supported on AbstractionKit

While Voltaire Bundler is provided as JSON API for gas estimation, submission, and status tracking, AbstractionKit SDK simplifies this process further by offering pre-built tools and a [standard Bundler class](https://docs.candide.dev/wallet/abstractionkit/bundler/) for TypeScript, enabling developers to quickly implement advanced features, including optimal gas management. Most importantly, AbstractionKit is agnostic of any Bundler that adheres to the ERC-4337 standard, avoiding vendor lock-in with Voltaire. With update to date docs and developer-friendly classes, developers can efficiently build, innovate, and scale their apps.

## Fast execution

Voltaire v0.1.0a33 stands out as one of the fastest executors in the ERC-4337 ecosystem, with near-complete coverage of the official [compatibility test suites](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler-test-executor) developed by the ERC-4337 team. Impressively, Voltaire completed the test suite in just 1:51. As performance metrics evolve with each commit, staying updated on the latest results by following the repository is important. Voltaire's speed and robustness make it the leading choice for high-performance applications.

## **Accurate Gas Estimates**

Voltaireâ€™s advanced gas estimation ensures that users and developers alike can be trusted to provide precise gas predictions in a cost-sensitive environment during high block demands. By reducing the likelihood of overpaying for gas or encountering failed transactions due to underestimating, Voltaire delivers a significant advantage to developers focused on optimizing their applications for real-world use.

## Getting Started with Voltaire

Getting started with Voltaire is completely easy and at no cost. Developers can begin by testing their applications with [free testnet support](/wallet/bundler/rpc-endpoints/) across multiple networks. Once ready for mainnet deployment, Voltaire offers flexible subscription plans designed to meet the needs of solo developers, startups, and enterprises. These plans provide scalable access to advanced features such as higher API rate limits, a larger number of API requests, and dedicated support. Voltaire is open-source, so self-hosting is encouraged if desired. 

Voltaire Bundler is coming soon as self-served on the Dashboard. In the meantime, you can reach out directly to get Mainnet Access via [Discord](https://discord.gg/8q2H6BEJuf), or by emailing [**team@candidelabs.com**](mailto:team@candidelabs.com). The team guarantees a same-day response.
