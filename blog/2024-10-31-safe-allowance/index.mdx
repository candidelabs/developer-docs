# Safe Allowance: Permission-Based System for Secure Automation 

Automating token actions should be simple, safe, and secure. With the new **Safe Allowance Module**, we’re excited to offer a permission-based system that enables controlled access to tokens, making it easier to set up secure automation. Whether you’re handling recurring payments, subscriptions, or specific smart contract actions, this module provides a foundation for secure and permissioned transactions.

## Why Choose the Safe Allowance Module?

Traditional systems for sharing account access often involve broad permissions, granting more access than necessary for simple tasks. The Safe Allowance Module changes this by using a permission-based approach. It allows account owners to set up specific, controlled permissions for delegates, such as individual accounts or automated services, enabling them to handle predefined transactions securely. This module doesn’t automate transactions on its own but provides a safe framework where authorized automation services can operate as delegates, precisely according to the owner's permissions.

**Key Features:**

* **Controlled Permissions:** Account owners decide who can access funds, which tokens they’re allowed to use, and under what conditions. No surprises—just clear, permissioned access**.**  
* **Customizable Setup:** Owners can establish permissions that fit their needs, from one-time transactions to recurring. It’s a streamlined approach to token automation.

## Real-World Use Cases of the Safe Allowance Module

### Recurring Transfers
For recurring transfers—such as stipends, or scheduled payments—the Safe Allowance Module allows users to define permissions for a delegate, who then handle the regular transactions. Once permissions are set, automation services can operate securely, automating processes without needing repeated approvals.

### Subscription
Automating monthly subscription becomes seamless. Users can authorize automation services to make secure, consistent payments every cycle, ensuring funds are transferred reliably and securely.

### Investment with Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)
For users managing investments through dollar-cost averaging, the Safe Allowance Module enables secure permissions for regular buys. By defining token allowance and schedule, users can allow automation services to handle scheduled buys safely.

### Custom Contract Delegations
The module’s flexible permission system empowers developers to design tailored settings for specific use cases. Examples include automated debt repayment for lending platforms like AAVE, or any other custom smart contract operations. 

## Getting Started

### Safe Allowance in AbstractionKit

Safe Allowance is integrated in *AbstractionKit*, simplifying the setup of permission-based token transfers within Safe Smart Accounts. AbstractionKit’s intuitive interface allows developers to configure delegate permissions effortlessly, unlocking secure automation with ease.
