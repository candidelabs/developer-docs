# Real-World Applications of InstaGas Policies

InstaGas policies enable a wide range of possibilities across sectors where onboarding, marketing, incentives, and privacy are critical. 
InstaGas offers diverse use cases across multiple industries:

| Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **DeFi Exchanges** | Cover gas fees for token swaps or liquidity provision. This is useful for marketing campaigns, new user onboarding, or high-volume traders. |
| **NFT Drops** | Sponsor gas fees for fresh mints, even during high network congestion. This helps your collection find more participants and reduces all friction for collectors. |
| **Lending Protocols** | Sponsor key actions such as loan creation, collateral adjustments, or repayments, by setting a minimum for deposits and withdrawals. |
| **L2 Rollups and EVM Chains** | Sponsor bridging gas fees from the origin chain to your destination chain using your canonical bridge or third parties. |
| **Liquid staking** | Liquid stacked tokens and their wrapped versions leave users without options to make a single transaction after staking all their native tokens. |
| **Web3 Games** | Gas-free in-game transactions, allowing players to mint NFTs, transfer assets, or make a minimum purchase without needing to manage native tokens. |
| **Charity and Donations** | Nonprofits can sponsor gas fees for donors. A minimum donation threshold can be set to apply for sponsorship. |
| **DAO Governance Participation** | Sponsor gas fees for governance actions like voting, submitting proposals, or delegating tokens. |
| **Subscription Services** | Any recurring actions, such as Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), can automate and cover recurring transaction fees for users. |
| **Private Actions** | By covering gas fees, users don't need to complete KYC to purchase ETH. It also enables ETH-less token withdrawals sent to stealth addresses. |
