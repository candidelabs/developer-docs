# InstaGas

InstaGas is a **no-code** platform enabling you to sponsor gas fees for end users by creating customized gas policies tailored to specific smart contracts and use cases.

## Who is This For?

InstaGas is designed for apps that want to simplify user experience by abstracting gas costs **without complex wallet integration**.
InstaGas is ideal for:

* DeFi exchanges
* Lending protocols
* Web3 games
* NFT collections and marketplaces
* And more

For more examples, visit our [Use Cases Categories](/instagas/usecases) page.

## How It Works

1. Set up a gas policy on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.candide.dev)
2. Make the policy `public` by toggling the privacy rule in General Rules settings
3. Customize your policy with rules aligned with your app's needs
4. Top up your team balance and transfer funds to the policy

Once your policy is active:

- It becomes discoverable by all wallets using Candide's [Paymaster API](/wallet/paymaster/rpc-methods/)
- Any transaction matching the policy's rules will have gas fees sponsored
- Monitor policy performance through the Analytics and UserOperation tabs

## Rules Overview

InstaGas provides customizable rules for gas policies, categorized into four sections:
1. General Rules
2. Account Rules
3. Access Rules
4. Transaction Rules
