# InstaGas

## Introduction

A no-code platform that allows applications on Ethereum, Layer 2 networks, and EVM compatible chains to define gas policies to directly sponsor gas 
for Smart Wallets end-users, **without the need for API calls or code integration on the dApp client.** A standard for Paymaster RPC endpoints is part of the solution, 
but the main benefits are lost if dApps are still required to write code to sponsor gas with different smart contract wallet implementations. 

InstaGas receives transactions from end-usersâ€™ Smart Wallets and checks for applicable gas policies set up by sponsors. If a matching policy is found, 
InstaGas returns a valid sponsorship signature. Gas policies are configured using customizable rules, ranging from generic to account-based, access-based, 
and transaction-specific rules. Simple gas policies require only a few basic rules to set up, while more complex ones may involve transaction rules that scan 
for contract interactions, input parameters, and predefined limits. InstaGas, by design, is secured against draining attacks, provided that the gas policy 
is properly configured to enforce the desired behavior.

## The Problem
Without a Paymaster, anyone sending an Ethereum transaction must possess ETH to cover gas fees, forcing new users to complete KYC processes 
and purchase ETH before accessing any dApp. With the growing demand for better user experiences and the introduction of the Account Abstraction standard, 
Smart Wallets have emerged to cover gas fees on behalf of their users. However, this shift places dApps in a challenging position, as they lose control 
over their user onboarding processes. To sponsor gas for end-user Smart Wallets, dApps have had to implement complex, custom code for each wallet integration, 
and some even resort to offering their own embedded wallets to enhance user experience.
