# EIP-7702

EIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that empowers Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with smart contract wallet functionalities by enabling 
the deployment of code directly at their address. This improvement allows EOAs to perform complex operations typically reserved for smart contracts.

## Key Features

### Batching
   This feature allows users to execute multiple operations in a single atomic transaction. A common use case is the combination of an ERC-20 approval 
   followed by the spending of that approval. Currently, this workflow requires two separate transactions in decentralized exchanges (DEXes). 
   Advanced batching scenarios may involve dependencies, where the output of one operation serves as the input for another, streamlining complex workflows.

### Gas Sponsorship
   EIP-7702 enables one account (Account X) to pay for transactions on behalf of another account (Account Y). This can facilitate various use cases, such as:
   - Account X receiving payment in a different ERC-20 token for the transaction service.
   - Application operators covering transaction costs for their users, thereby improving user experience by eliminating the need for users to 
     hold native tokens for transaction fees.

### Privilege De-escalation
   Users can create sub-keys with specific permissions that are more limited than the global access of the main account. This feature improves 
   security and control over account operations. Examples of privilege de-escalation include:
   - Granting permission to spend ERC-20 tokens while restricting access to ETH.
   - Allowing a sub-key to spend only up to 1% of the total balance per day.
   - Limiting interactions to specific applications, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Forward-compatibility with Account Abstraction

This EIP is designed to be very forward-compatible with endgame account abstraction, without over-enshrining any fine-grained details of ERC-4337 or RIP-7560.

Specifically:
    - The address that users sign can directly point to existing ERC-4337 wallet code.
    - The "code pathways" used are often the same as those in a fully smart contract wallet environment, making them compatible.
    - This approach helps avoid the issue of creating two separate code ecosystems, as they largely remain unified. While some workflows may still need workarounds, 
    these are relatively few compared to the overall functionality.
    - It does not require adding any new opcodes that would become unnecessary in a future without Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).
    - It allows EOAs to function like smart contracts, enabling them to be included in ERC-4337 bundles while remaining compatible with the existing EntryPoint.

## Limitation
While EIP-7702 brings significant improvements to Ethereum EOA wallets, it's essential to understand the full picture:

- **Private key access remains**: The original key will always maintain admin access to the upgraded account, limiting the security benefits an EOA wallet can offer.    
- **Portability limitations**: Upgraded EOAs to Smart Accounts are tied to a specific wallet, and transferring to a new wallet will be a security-critical operation, unless all wallets adopt the same smart contracts (which is unlikely).
