# Onchain Tracking - Adding an identifier to your Safes Accounts 

This guide explains how to add an on-chain identifier to your Safe Accounts, allowing you to track and recognize your Safe transactions 
from other wallets, tracking your user adoption.

## Generate an on-chain identifier  

```ts
import { SafeAccountV0_3_0 } from "abstractionkit"

const smartAccount = SafeAccountV0_3_0.initializeNewAccount(
    [ownerPublicAddress],
    //highlight-start
    { onChainIdentifierParams: { project: "PROJECT_NAME" } }
    //highlight-end
)
```

In this example, we initialize a new Safe account and include an `onChainIdentifierParams` object with a project property set to "PROJECT_NAME". 
This will add a unique identifier to all transactions made with this Safe account, allowing you to easily track and recognize them among other Safe 
wallet transactions.

## Getting the on-chain identifier

```ts
const onchainIdentifier = smartAccount.onChainIdentifier
```

The `onChainIdentifier` property of the smartAccount object will contain the generated identifier, as well as other useful information of the tooling you've used.

You can see how we generate the identifier by seeing the source code of [generateOnChainIdentifier](https://github.com/candidelabs/abstractionkit/blob/main/src/account/Safe/SafeAccount.ts#L2819)
method. 

<details>
<summary>What's the format of the identifier?</summary>

The identifiers used to track Safe deployments are 50 bytes in length and follow the format below:

`5afe` `00` `6363643438383836663461336661366162653539` `646561` `393238` `653366`

Check the last 50 bytes of the data field in this [example transaction](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe0192eedd1fc2d06be0561d57380d610dd6d162af0f3cfbd6c08f9062d738761)
to see how the identifier appears after the transaction is executed.

#### Prefix hash

- Type: 2 bytes
- Example: 5afe

Static prefix to identify the Safe on-chain identifier.

#### Version hash

- Type: 1 byte
- Example: 00

Version number of the Safe on-chain identifier format.
#### Project hash

- Type: 20 bytes
- Example: 6363643438383836663461336661366162653539

Truncated hash of the project's name (for example, "Gnosis", "CoW Swap").
#### Platform hash

- Type: 3 bytes
- Example: 646561

Truncated hash of the platform's name (for example, "Web", "Mobile", "Safe App", "Widget").
#### Tool hash

- Type: 3 bytes
- Example: 393238

Truncated hash of the tool's name (for example, "protocol-kit", "relay-kit", or any custom tool built by projects).
#### Tool version hash

- Type: 3 bytes
- Example: 653366

Truncated hash of the tool's version (for example, "1.0.0", "1.0.1").
