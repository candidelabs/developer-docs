# On-Chain Tracking - Adding an Identifier to Your Safe Accounts

This guide explains how to add an on-chain identifier to your Safe Accounts, enabling you to track and distinguish your Safe transactions from other wallets and monitor user adoption.

## Generate an On-Chain Identifier  

```ts
import { SafeAccountV0_3_0 } from "abstractionkit"

const smartAccount = SafeAccountV0_3_0.initializeNewAccount(
    [ownerPublicAddress],
    //highlight-start
    { onChainIdentifierParams: { project: "PROJECT_NAME" } }
    //highlight-end
)
```

This example initializes a new Safe account with an `onChainIdentifierParams` object containing a project property set to "PROJECT_NAME".
This adds a unique identifier to all transactions from this Safe account, enabling easy tracking and recognition among other Safe wallet transactions.

## Getting the On-Chain Identifier

```ts
const onchainIdentifier = smartAccount.onChainIdentifier
```

The `onChainIdentifier` property contains the generated identifier and additional information about the tooling used.

View the identifier generation in the [generateOnChainIdentifier](https://github.com/candidelabs/abstractionkit/blob/main/src/account/Safe/SafeAccount.ts#L2819) source code. 

<details>
<summary>What's the format of the identifier?</summary>

The identifiers used to track Safe deployments are 50 bytes in length and follow the format below:

`5afe` `00` `6363643438383836663461336661366162653539` `646561` `393238` `653366`

Check the last 50 bytes of the data field in this [example transaction](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe0192eedd1fc2d06be0561d57380d610dd6d162af0f3cfbd6c08f9062d738761)
to see how the identifier appears after the transaction is executed.

#### Prefix hash

- Type: 2 bytes
- Example: 5afe

Static prefix to identify the Safe on-chain identifier.

#### Version hash

- Type: 1 byte
- Example: 00

Version number of the Safe on-chain identifier format.
#### Project hash

- Type: 20 bytes
- Example: 6363643438383836663461336661366162653539

Truncated hash of the project's name (for example, "Gnosis", "CoW Swap").
#### Platform hash

- Type: 3 bytes
- Example: 646561

Truncated hash of the platform's name (for example, "Web", "Mobile", "Safe App", "Widget").
#### Tool hash

- Type: 3 bytes
- Example: 393238

Truncated hash of the tool's name (for example, "protocol-kit", "relay-kit", or any custom tool built by projects).
#### Tool version hash

- Type: 3 bytes
- Example: 653366

Truncated hash of the tool's version (for example, "1.0.0", "1.0.1").
