# Simulate Transactions with Tenderly

This guide will walk you through using abtractionkit to simulate UserOperations and raw smart contract calldata with [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/). 
Simulating transactions allows you to:

* Test transaction behaviors.
* Debug potential issues before they occur on-chain.
* Verify outcomes and state changes.
* Potentially show end-users a preview of what their transaction will do before they sign.

**To run a complete example**: [simulate-with-tenderly](https://github.com/candidelabs/abstractionkit-examples/blob/main/simulate-with-tenderly/simulate-with-tenderly.ts).
 
## Configuration

You will need the following configured with tenderly in order to use their services. 

1. Visit [dashboard.tenderly.co](https://dashboard.tenderly.co)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to Settings >> Integration

```env
TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG=
TENDERLY_PROJECT_SlUG=
TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY=
```


## Simulate User Operation 

```ts
import { simulateUserOperationWithTenderlyAndCreateShareLink } from "abstractionkit";

const tenderlyAccountSlug = process.env.TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG as string
const tenderlyProjectSlug = process.env.TENDERLY_PROJECT_SlUG as string
const tenderlyAccessKey = process.env.TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY as string

const userOpSimulationLink = await simulateUserOperationWithTenderlyAndCreateShareLink(
    tenderlyAccountSlug,
    tenderlyProjectSlug,
    tenderlyAccessKey,
    chainId,
    entrypointAddress,
    userOperation
);

console.log("userop simulation link: ", userOpSimulationLink);
```

## Simulate Safe CallData 

```ts
import { SafeAccountV0_3_0 as SafeAccount} from "abstractionkit";

const smartAccount = SafeAccount.initializeNewAccount(
    [ownerPublicAddress],
);

const metaTx: MetaTransaction = {
    to: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    value: 0n,
    data: "0x",
};

// highlight-start
const callDataSimulatedLink = await smartAccount.simulateCallDataWithTenderlyAndCreateShareLink(
    tenderlyAccountSlug,
    tenderlyProjectSlug,
    tenderlyAccessKey,
    nodeUrl,
    chainId,
    [metaTx],
);
// highlight-end

console.log("calldata simulation link: ", callDataSim.callDataSimulationShareLink);
```
