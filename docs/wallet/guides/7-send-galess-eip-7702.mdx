# How to Send a Gasless Transaction | EIP-7702

**Smart EOAs via EIP-7702**

EIP-7702 allows regular Ethereum EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) to act as smart accounts for a transaction. This enables features like gas sponsorship, multisig, and more, without permanently converting the EOA.

With EIP-7702, users can benefit from gasless transactions by leveraging publicly available gas policies set up by third parties on InstaGasâ€”like PoolTogether, Revoke, AAVE, and many more. If no matching public gas policy is found for the user operation, you can fall back to a private gas policy of your own.

Definitions:

- **Public Gas Policies**: Gas sponsorships provided by Dapps and do not require a sponsorship policy ID.
- **Private Gas Policies**: Require a sponsorship policy ID and can be used by the wallet if no public gas policy matches the user operation.

Steps to Implement Gasless Transactions:

1. Create a new app on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.candide.dev) and copy the Paymaster RPC URL into your `.env` file.
2. Optionally, set up a Private Gas Policy on the dashboard and copy its sponsorship policy ID into your `.env` file.
