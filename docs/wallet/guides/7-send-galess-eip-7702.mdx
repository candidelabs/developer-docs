# How to Send a Gasless Transaction | EIP-7702

**Smart EOAs via EIP-7702**

Enable users to benefit from gasless transactions by offering publicly available gas policies set up by third parties on InstaGas
like PoolTogether, AAVE, Unizen and many more. If no matching public gas policy is found for the user operation, you can fall back to a private gas policy of your own.

Definitions:

- **Public Gas Policies**: Gas sponsorships provided by Dapps and do not require a sponsorship policy ID.
- **Private Gas Policies**: Require a sponsorship policy ID and can be used by the wallet if no public gas policy matches the user operation.

Steps to Implement Gasless Transactions:

1. Create a new app on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.candide.dev) and copy the Paymaster RPC URL into your `.env` file.
2. Optionally, set up a Private Gas Policy on the dashboard and copy its sponsorship policy ID into your `.env` file.

If you would like to see full example, you can reference it [here](https://github.com/candidelabs/abstractionkit-examples/blob/main/eip-7702/upgrade-eoa-to-7702-smart-account-sponsored-gas.ts).
