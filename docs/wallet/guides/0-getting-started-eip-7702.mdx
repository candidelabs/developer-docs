# EIP-7702 Quickstart

EIP-7702 upgrades current Ethereum External Owned Accounts (EOAs) by upgrading them to smart contract accounts

- **Gas sponsorship**: abstract away gas fees, allowing third-party sponsorship or payment in ERC-20 tokens
- **Transaction batching**: improve UX and security by combining approvals and contract interactions into a single step
- **Permissions**: grant specific, limited access to third-parties, enabling use cases like recurring payments
- **Forward compatibility with end-game AA**: Remains compatible with ERC-4337 and future native account abstraction.

To learn more about EIP-7702, visit the dedicated [7702 Overview](/account-abstraction/7702/overview).

In this example, you will learn how to upgrade an EOA to a Smart Account to leverage features such as batching and gas sponsorship

## Prerequisites

- Node and a package manager (yarn or npm)
- Sepolia ETH from Faucets. Shoot us on [discord](https://discord.gg/7Xb6ECfNFZ) if you need some

Here's the [complete code](https://github.com/candidelabs/abstractionkit/tree/experimental7702/examples/SimpleAccount/UpgradeEOAto7702SimpleAccountAndSendTransaction) for you to reference if you prefer to run directly.


## Step 1: Get setup

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir candide-eip7702-upgrade-eoa
cd candide-eip7702-upgrade-eoa
yarn init
```

2. Install required dependencies

```bash
yarn add abstractionkit@0.2.15 dotenv
```

:::note
```abstractionkit@0.2.15``` is experimental version release with EIP-7702 support before the official upgrade with Pectra.
:::

3. Configure Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables with your own values 

```bash title=".env"
CHAIN_ID=11155111
JSON_RPC_NODE_PROVIDER=https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
BUNDLER_URL=https://sepolia.voltaire.candidewallet.com/rpc

#EOA public & private key
PRIVATE_KEY=PRIVATE_KEY
PUBLIC_ADDRESS=PUBLIC_KEY
```

4. Create a empty file and a function to run our script

```ts title="index.ts"
async function main(): Promise<void> {
  // Rest of the code will go here...
}

main();
```

## Step 2: Fund your EOA

Let's open up `index.ts`
 
We will need to fund the account with native tokens to execute the authorization tx, also know as the delegation to the smart account. 
We will write some simple checks to verify balance of the EOA before continuing to the next steps.

```ts title="index.ts"
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { sendJsonRpcRequest } from "abstractionkit";
  
async function main(): Promise<void> {
  //get values from .env
  dotenv.config();
  const jsonRpcNodeProvider = process.env.JSON_RPC_NODE_PROVIDER as string;
  const eoaDelegatorPublicKey = process.env.PUBLIC_ADDRESS as string;

  const balance = await sendJsonRpcRequest(
      jsonRpcNodeProvider,
      "eth_getBalance",
      [eoaDelegatorPublicKey, "latest",]
  ) as string; 

  if (BigInt(balance) === 0n) {
      console.log("Please fund the EOA Address with a sufficient balance of the native token to proceed");
      console.log("Address: ", eoaDelegatorPublicKey);
      return;
  }
}

main();
```

## Step 3: Generate Account Address

To generate an account address, we will be using [Simple7702Account](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/accounts/Simple7702Account.sol),
a fully audited minimalist smart contract account that can be safely authorized by any EOA. It adds full support for major smart account features like batching and gas sponsorship.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Simple7702Account } from "abstractionkit";

const smartAccount = new Simple7702Account(eoaDelegatorPublicKey);

console.log("Account address(sender) : " + smartAccount.accountAddress);
```

Let's run this code

```cli title="Terminal"
npx ts-node index.ts
```

If everything worked, you will get the calculate address of the smart account in the console.

<details>
<summary>Result example</summary>
Account address(sender): 0x32afdcfa1e3bfe70d03ecb55b5c8045c26515c9d
</details>

## Step 3: Generate the callData

Not only we can upgrade the EOA to a smart account, we will also be demonstrating how to execute minting two NFTs, all in the same transaction.  

```ts title="index.ts"
import {
  MetaTransaction,
  getFunctionSelector,
  createCallData,
} from "abstractionkit";

// We will be mitting two random NFTs in a single tx
const nftContractAddress = "0x9a7af758aE5d7B6aAE84fe4C5Ba67c041dFE5336";
const mintFunctionSignature = 'mint(address)';
const mintFunctionSelector = getFunctionSelector(mintFunctionSignature);
const mintTransactionCallData = createCallData(
    mintFunctionSelector,
    ["address"],
    [smartAccount.accountAddress]
);
const transaction1: MetaTransaction = {
    to: nftContractAddress,
    value: 0n,
    data: mintTransactionCallData,
}

const transaction2: MetaTransaction = {
    to: nftContractAddress,
    value: 0n,
    data: mintTransactionCallData,
}
```

## Step 4: Create UserOperation
Now the fun part. Call `createUserOperation`, which will:

1. Compute the r and s values for the `eip7702Auth`. These values are part of signature authorization tuple needed to upgrade the EOA
2. Determine the nonce and fetch the gas prices from the provided node rpc
3. Estimate gas limits from the provided bundler

This returns a unsigned user operation. Use `calculateUserOperationMaxGasCost` to calculate its cost.

```ts title="index.ts"
import {
  ...
  // highlight-start
  calculateUserOperationMaxGasCost
  // highlight-end
} from "abstractionkit";

const bundlerUrl = process.env.BUNDLER_URL as string;
const chainId = BigInt(process.env.CHAIN_ID as string);
const eoaDelegatorPrivateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string;

let userOperation = await smartAccount.createUserOperation(
    [transaction1, transaction2],
    jsonRpcNodeProvider,
    bundlerUrl,
    {
        eip7702Auth:{
            chainId, // chainId at which the account will be upgraded
        }
    }
);

const cost = calculateUserOperationMaxGasCost(userOperation)
console.log("This useroperation may cost upto : " + cost + " wei")
console.log("Please fund the sender account : " + userOperation.sender +" with more than " + cost + " wei")
```

## Step 5: Sign the Delegate Authorization

Sign the `eip7702Auth` tuple to delegate the authorization to the smart account. This is only called once, during the upgrade transaction of the EOA.

```ts
userOperation.eip7702Auth = createAndSignEip7702DelegationAuthorization(
    BigInt(userOperation.eip7702Auth.chainId),
    userOperation.eip7702Auth.address,
    BigInt(userOperation.eip7702Auth.nonce),
    eoaDelegatorPrivateKey
)
```

## Step 6: Sign and Submit

1. Call `signUserOperation`, which will create a signature for the private key provided of the owner of the EOA.

```ts title="index.ts"
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string;

userOperation.signature = smartAccount.signUserOperation(
    userOperation,
    eoaDelegatorPrivateKey,
    chainId,
);
```

2. Use the Bundler URL to send the userop to the bundler with `sendUserOperation`, and await the return `SendUseroperationResponse` object to confirm the on-chain inclusion of the user operation. 

```ts title="index.ts"
const sendUserOperationResponse = await smartAccount.sendUserOperation(userOperation, bundlerUrl)

console.log("UserOperation sent. Waiting to be included ......")
```

3. Track the userOperation and wait for its inclusion onchain 
```ts
// highlight-start
let userOperationReceiptResult = await sendUserOperationResponse.included()
// highlight-end

console.log("Useroperation receipt received.")
console.log(userOperationReceiptResult)

if (userOperationReceiptResult.success) {
    console.log("EOA upgraded to a Smart Account and minted two Nfts! The transaction hash is : " + userOperationReceiptResult.receipt.transactionHash)
} else {
    console.log("Useroperation execution failed")
}
```

Now let's run this code again

```cli title="Terminal"
npx ts-node index.ts
```

You've now sent upgrade your EOA to a Smart Account! If everything went well, you should see the bundler returning a user operation receipt

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```terminal
Useroperation sent. Waiting to be included ......
Useroperation receipt received.

EOA upgraded to a Smart Account and minted two Nfts! The transaction hash is : 0x763dc353dee853da059b9e8c4b9997cccd4597b4cfcfc5fc3133dcffc778d93a

You can lookup the hash on explorers that supports user operations like [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/).

In the next guides, we will show how to use sponsored gas policies using paymasters.
