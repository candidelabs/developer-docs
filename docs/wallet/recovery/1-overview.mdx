## Overview

A UX and a security service for Safe [Recovery Contracts](https://github.com/candidelabs/candide-contracts), 
streamlining the recovery process for account owners and their designated recovery contacts.

## Who is this for

Wallets applications integrating Candide's Social Recovery Module, and want to offer a seamless and secure recovery experience for their end-users.

## Features

### Signature Aggregation and Storage
Guardians signatures can be sent to the service to allow off-chain collection. The service can then automatically execute the recovery confirmation and finalization
once all required signatures have been collected.

### Automatic Execution
The service offers automatic execuction options to minimize UX friction and increase privacy for recovery contacts / guardians. 
It can be configured to automatically execute:

1. The confirmation recovery transaction after the signature threshold is met, eliminating the need for guardians to cover gas costs.
2. The finalization transaction after the grace period ends, avoding recovery contacts to return back to complete the process.

### Gas Sponsorship Relayer
It includes a gas sponsorship relayer, which cover the gas costs for both confirmation and finilization

### Alerts and Notifications
Account owners can subscribe to receive notifications via email or SMS when a recovery request is initiated, whether onchain or through the service, ensuring they stay informed during a recovery process.
The service keeps track of transactions sent via the *Safe Recovery Module* and uses events and tracing to index transactions to send timely alerts.  

### A Communication System
It provides a communication system using emojis that enables guardians to verify and approve legitimate recovery requests, effectively preventing social phishing 
attempts by malicious actors who may try to manipulate the recovery process.
