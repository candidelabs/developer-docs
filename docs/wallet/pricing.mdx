# The Fastest Path to Production.

From your first line of code to your millionth transaction, we give you the infrastructure and support to ship fast and scale confidently.

Start building for free. The Starter tier includes the complete AbstractionKit SDK, all account features (Passkeys, Social Recovery, Unified Accounts), and unlimited testnet access — no credit card required. With 2,500 mainnet UserOps on the free tier, it's the most generous free tier in the industry. Upgrade when you're ready to go to production.

<PricingCards />

> **UserOps (User Operations)** are the standard unit for Smart Account transactions. 1 UserOp ≈ 10 API Requests.

## Gas Sponsorship

Gas is always passed through at cost — we never mark up gas prices. The included ops per month are free. After the included amount, a small service fee applies.

## FAQ

### Usage

#### When does the 90-day timer start?
On your first mainnet UserOperation. Testnet usage doesn't start the clock.

#### What counts as a "Mainnet UserOp"?
Any transaction on a production network (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, etc.). Testnet transactions don't count.

#### What happens when I hit the free tier limit?
Mainnet access pauses. Testnet continues working. Upgrade to Launch to restore mainnet immediately.

#### Can I switch between tiers?
Yes. Upgrade anytime. Downgrade takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle.

#### Do I need a credit card for the free tier?
No. Start building immediately. Add payment when you upgrade.

#### What if I outgrow Launch but don't need all of Grow?
Reach out for custom quotes or add-ons.

### Exclusive Networks

#### What is an Exclusive Network?
Networks not available by default at Candide that can be supported on request. Any EVM-equivalent chain is supported — including your own L2 (Arbitrum Orbit, OP Stack, Polygon CDK, ZK Stack, etc.). We deploy all smart contracts and bundler infrastructure.

---

### Support

#### What support do I get with each tier?
- Starter: Community Discord (best-effort)
- Launch: Slack/Telegram (24h response) — reactive support. You ask, we answer any question
- Grow: Slack/Telegram (4h business hours / 6h nights & weekends) + dedicated account team who proactively monitors your account
- Enterprise: Slack/Telegram (1h business hours / 4h nights & weekends) + dedicated account team with 24/7 incident response

#### What is Flash Support?
Pay-per-incident emergency support ($149 per incident, max 2/year). When production breaks, activate Flash Support and get a 1-hour response (business hours) or 4-hour response (nights & weekends) for that specific incident. Not a subscription — pay only when you need it. Available as an add-on on the Launch plan.
