# Introduction to AbstractionKit

![image](/img/posters/abstractionkit-poster.png)

A Typescript Library to easily build and send ERC-4337 UserOperations, with first class support for Safe Accounts, and Simple EIP-7702 Account.

AbstractionKit encapsulates the standard's complexities and offers developers unparalleled flexibility to craft Smart Wallets, without the hassle of intricate details.
Seamlessly use Safe Accounts, construct callData, estimate and sponsor gas (completely or with ERC-20 tokens), send UserOps to Bundlers and more – all while benefiting from being type-safe.

- AbstractionKit is agnostic of:
  - Ethereum interface libraries: ethers, web3.js, viem/wagmi
  - Bundler implentation: Plug and play from any bundler provider
  - Paymaster services: use any 3rd party paymaster, or build your own

## Why AbstractionKit

Smart contract wallets are hard to build. We learned this from developing [Candide Wallet](https://candidewallet.com), one of the first Smart Wallets. We wrote its smart
contracts, got it audited, developed a compliant Bundler and designed paymaster gas features. Until we realized we've spent more on infrastructure than
our actual product, which was the consumer facing app. What we've built wasn't just for us; it was what developers like. 
So, we refocused. AbstractionKit is our commitment to provide an SDK that let you build on smart accounts in days, not months.

### At the frontier of Efficiency
AbstractionKit is engineered for optimal performance by minimizing HTTPS requests to the key infra (Node, Bundler, Paymaster). 
We do this writing cryptographic techniques to calculate complex smart account signatures offline. Fewer HTTPS requests not only lower your 
infrastructure costs not also gives you vastly improved, snappier user experience. Don't just take our word for it—we encourage you to verify. 
Compare the performance of AbstractionKit against other account abstraction libraries in [AA-SDK-Benchmark](https://aa-sdk-benchmark.on-fleek.app/).

### Secure Smart Accounts
AbstractionKit distributes [Safe Accounts](/wallet/abstractionkit/safe-account/), the battle-tested smart accounts securing billions of dollars in assets across Ethereum and other 
EVM-compatible chains. We particularly chose to integrate Safe due to their unparalleled security track record, extensive audits, 
and widespread community trust, making them the leading standard for secure smart contract wallets. It also distributes [Simple7702Account](/wallet/abstractionkit/simple-7702-account/),
developed by the authors of Account Abstraction themselves to enable EAOs to upgrade to Smart Accounts.

### Extensible

Each core component—Bundler, Paymaster, and Account—is built separately and modularly, like Lego blocks, allowing for tailored configurations and extensions. 
You can build your own smart account plugins, integrate social logins via various third-party authentication services, or even use it with different 
smart account implementations beyond the *Safe* and *Simple* Accounts.

### Vendor-Agnostic
We truly mean it when we say vendor-agnostic. AbstractionKit strictly adheres to Ethereum Account Abstraction standards. This ensures your product works
with Candide's infrastructure and any other compliant Account Abstraction provider, such as Alchemy, Pimlico, and Etherspot. While Candide is the 
longest-standing provider in this space and isn't going anywhere, our commitment to open standards means your product's longevity isn't tied to us. 
If Candide were to cease operations, your app would continue to function with alternative providers. You can verify Candide's Voltaire, as the 
most compliant in the industry on [ERC-4337 Bundlers website](https://www.erc4337.io/bundlers).
