# Introduction to AbstractionKit

![image](/img/posters/abstracitonkit-blog-poster.png)

A Typescript Library to easily build and send ERC-4337 UserOperations, with first class support for Safe Accounts.

AbstractionKit encapsulates the standard's complexities and offers developers unparalleled flexibility to craft Smart Wallets, without the hassle of intricate details.
Seamlessly use Safe Accounts, construct callData, estimate and sponsor gas (completly or with ERC-20 tokens), send UserOps to Bundlers and more – all while benefiting from being type-safe.

- AbstractionKit is agnostic of:
  - Ethereum interface libraries: ethers, web3.js, viem/wagmi
  - Bundler implentation: Plug and play from any bundler provider
  - Paymaster services: use any 3rd party paymaster, or build your own

## Why AbstractionKit

Building production-ready smart contract wallets is notoriously complex and time-consuming. We know this firsthand from developing Candide Wallet, 
one of the earliest fully-fledged smart wallets. That journey involved months of intensive work: architecting smart account contracts, 
implementing an Ethereum Standards-compliant Bundler, engineering gas sponsorship features, and let alone building the user interface. 
Having built this powerful infrastructure, we realized its immense value to the broader ecosystem. That’s why we created AbstractionKit: 
to distill our expertise into a comprehensive toolkit that gives every company worldwide to build and launch a Smart Account in days, 
not months.

### Fast and Efficient
AbstractionKit is engineered for optimal performance by minimizing HTTPS requests to the all infra: Node / Bundler / Paymaster, leading to a faster product experience. 
We achieve this by employing cryptographic techniques to calculate complex smart account signatures offline, reducing the need for external 
calls to the Bundler or Node. Fewer HTTPS requests not only lower your infrastructure costs but also hugely improve user experience with enhanced 
speed. Don't just take our word for it—we encourage you to verify. Compare our performance benchmarks against other account abstraction libraries like 
in the [AA-SDK-Benchmark](https://aa-sdk-benchmark.on-fleek.app/).

### Developer-Friendly and Customizable
We are obsessed with making AbstractionKit exceptionally developer-friendly while ensuring it remains highly customizable for advanced use cases. 
While not strictly a "plug and play" solution, it is purposefully designed to be high-level enough for any TypeScript developer to integrate
smart accounts without needing deep expertise in the intricate details of ERC-4337 or EIP-7702 entry point interactions. Simultaneously, its design 
ensures developers can understand the flow of UserOperations and easily debug any issues during integration. AbstractionKit is also not dependent on 
specific Ethereum client libraries, allowing you to use it with your preferred tools like ethers.js or viem. Its minimal dependencies also contribute to its ease of maintenance.

### Secure Smart Accounts: Built with Safe
AbstractionKit distributes Safe Accounts, the battle-tested smart accounts securing billions of dollars in assets across Ethereum and other 
EVM-compatible chains. We particularly chose to integrate Safe due to their unparalleled security track record, extensive audits, 
and widespread community trust, making them the leading standard for secure smart contract wallets.

### Flexible and Extensible

AbstractionKit is designed for flexibility and extensibility. You can build smart account plugins, integrate social logins via various authentication 
services, or even use it with different smart account implementations beyond the default Safe Accounts. Each core component—Bundler, Paymaster, and 
Account—is built separately and modularly, like Lego blocks, allowing for tailored configurations and extensions.

### Truly Vendor-Agnostic
When we say vendor-agnostic, we mean it. AbstractionKit meticulously follows the official Ethereum Account Abstraction standards. 
This ensures your product will seamlessly operate not only with Candide's infrastructure but also with any other compliant Account Abstraction provider, 
such as Alchemy, Pimlico, and Etherspot. While Candide is a long-standing Account Abstraction infrastructure provider, our commitment to standards means 
your product's longevity is not tied to us; if Candide's were to cease, your app would continue to function with alternative 
providers.
