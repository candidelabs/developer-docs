# Introduction to AbstractionKit

![image](/img/posters/abstracitonkit-blog-poster.png)

A Typescript Library to easily build and send ERC-4337 UserOperations, with first class support for Safe Accounts, and Simple EIP-7702 Account.

AbstractionKit encapsulates the standard's complexities and offers developers unparalleled flexibility to craft Smart Wallets, without the hassle of intricate details.
Seamlessly use Safe Accounts, construct callData, estimate and sponsor gas (completly or with ERC-20 tokens), send UserOps to Bundlers and more – all while benefiting from being type-safe.

- AbstractionKit is agnostic of:
  - Ethereum interface libraries: ethers, web3.js, viem/wagmi
  - Bundler implentation: Plug and play from any bundler provider
  - Paymaster services: use any 3rd party paymaster, or build your own

## Why AbstractionKit

Smart contract wallets are hard to build. We learned this spending months developing Candide Wallet, one of the first. We built the complex 
infrastructure – contracts, a compliant Bundler, gas features. We realized this core tech wasn't just for us; it was what developers like you needed most.
So, we refocused. AbstractionKit is our commitment to provide an SDK that let you build on smart accounts and launch in days, not months.

### Fast and Efficient
AbstractionKit is engineered for optimal performance by minimizing HTTPS requests to the key infra (Node, Bundler, Paymaster). 
We do this writing cryptographic techniques to calculate complex smart account signatures offline. Fewer HTTPS requests not only lower your 
infrastructure costs not also gives you vastly improved, snappier user experience. Don't just take our word for it—we encourage you to verify. 
Compare the performance of AbstractionKit against other account abstraction libraries in [AA-SDK-Benchmark](https://aa-sdk-benchmark.on-fleek.app/).

### Secure Smart Accounts: Built with Safe
AbstractionKit distributes Safe Accounts, the battle-tested smart accounts securing billions of dollars in assets across Ethereum and other 
EVM-compatible chains. We particularly chose to integrate Safe due to their unparalleled security track record, extensive audits, 
and widespread community trust, making them the leading standard for secure smart contract wallets.

### Flexible and Extensible

AbstractionKit is designed for flexibility and extensibility. You can build smart account plugins, integrate social logins via various authentication 
services, or even use it with different smart account implementations beyond the default Safe Accounts. Each core component—Bundler, Paymaster, and 
Account—is built separately and modularly, like Lego blocks, allowing for tailored configurations and extensions.

### Truly Vendor-Agnostic
When we say vendor-agnostic, we mean it. AbstractionKit follows the Ethereum Account Abstraction standards, line by line. 
This guarantees your product will seamlessly operate not only with Candide's infra but also with any other compliant Account Abstraction provider, 
such as Alchemy, Pimlico, and Etherspot. While Candide is the longest-standing Account Abstraction infra provider and we won't disappear anytime soon, 
our commitment to standards means your product's longevity is not tied to us; if Candide's were to cease, your app would continue to function with 
alternative providers.
