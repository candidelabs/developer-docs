# Welcome to Candide

**Build User-Friendly Ethereum apps with Smart Accounts**

Candide provides a complete developer toolkit for Ethereum Account Abstraction, supporting ERC-4337 and EIP-7702.

## Why Smart Accounts?

Smart accounts eliminate the biggest UX barriers in Web3:
- No more gas tokens: Users can pay fees in any ERC-20 token or have fees sponsored
- Simplified onboarding: Login with email, social accounts, or passkeys instead of managing seed phrases  
- Enhanced security: Built-in recovery, multisig support, and spending limits
- Batch transactions: Execute multiple operations atomically in a single transaction

## Core Features

### Gas Abstraction
- Gasless transactions: [Sponsor user fees](/wallet/guides/send-gasless-tx/) with flexible rules and policies
- ERC-20 gas payments: Let users [pay gas in any token](/wallet/guides/pay-gas-in-erc20/) (USDC, DAI, etc.)

### Modern Authentication
- Passkey integration: [Onchain WebAuthn](/wallet/plugins/passkeys/) support for biometric login
- Social login: [Email and OAuth](/wallet/guides/authentication/#social--email) integration

### Advanced Transactions  
- Batch operations: [Execute multiple transactions](/wallet/guides/getting-started/#step-4-create-useroperation) atomically
- Spending controls: [Set limits and policies](/wallet/plugins/allowance) for subscriptions and recurring payments

### Security
- Account recovery: [Social Recovery](/wallet/plugins/recovery-with-guardians) or [traditional](/wallet/recovery/auth-api/) recovery options
- Multi-signature: A single account controlled with [multiple signatures](/wallet/guides/multisig/)

*Smart accounts are programmable contracts, unlocking transaction capabilities impossible with traditional EOAs.*

## Developer Tools

### AbstractionKit SDK
TypeScript library for building and sending UserOperations with native support for Safe (Gnosis Safe) Accounts and EIP-7702 Accounts. 
Includes utilities for transaction batching, gas estimation, and account deployment. Learn more on [why you should 
choose abstractionkit](/wallet/abstractionkit/introduction/).

### Infrastructure APIs
- [Bundler](/wallet/bundler/rpc-methods/): ERC-4337 compliant nodes on all major EVM chains for submitting UserOperations to the mempool
- [Paymaster](/wallet/paymaster/rpc-methods/): Gas abstraction service supporting both sponsorship and ERC-20 token payments with configurable policies
- [Account Recovery Service](/wallet/recovery/overview/): Offer users the ability to secure their accounts using email/sms coupled with an alert system

Access [Candide's Dashboard](https://dashboard.candide.dev) to manage your API keys and configure your integration.

### InstaGas  
No-code platform for configuring gas sponsorship policies. Set spending limits, whitelist contracts, and manage paymaster rules without deploying custom smart contracts.
