# Intro to Candide

Candide is the most complete smart account toolset with support for both ERC-4337 and [EIP-7702](/wallet/guides/getting-started-eip-7702/) Account Abstraction.

## UX Benefits

- **Gas Abstraction**
  - [Sponsor gas](/wallet/guides/send-gasless-tx/) with rules and policies
  - Offer [gas payments in erc-20](/wallet/guides/pay-gas-in-erc20/) tokens
- **Authentication made easy** 
  - [Passkeys Login](/wallet/plugins/passkeys/)
  - [Email/Social Login](/wallet/guides/authentication/#social--email)
- **Programmable Transactions**
  - Use [Spending Limits](/wallet/plugins/allowance) to offer subscriptions and reccuring/scheduled payments.
  - [Batch multiple transactions](/wallet/guides/getting-started/#step-4-create-useroperation) into one.
- **Familiar Security**
  - Account Recovery with [trusted contracts](/wallet/plugins/recovery-with-guardians) or with traditional [email/sms](/wallet/recovery/auth-api/)
  - Two Factor Auth using [Multisig](/wallet/guides/multisig/)

And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Because each account is a smart contract, contracts are programmable and enable arbitrarily advanced transaction functionalities. Unlike EOAs, which are limited by design.

## Products

- **AbstractionKit SDK**: A Typescript library to build and send UserOperations, with first class support for *Safe* Accounts and *Simple* Accounts.
- **InstaGas**: A no-code platform to sponsor gas fees for end-users using rules and policies
- **API**
  - **Bundler**: Nodes extension on all EVM compatible chains to send smart wallet type transactions
  - **Paymaster**: Off-chain verification API facilitating gas sponsorship for gasless and gas payments in erc-20 token
