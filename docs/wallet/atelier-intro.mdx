# Welcome to Candide

A TypeScript toolkit for building Ethereum smart wallets: gas sponsorship, passkeys, batch transactions, and account recovery, all on top of Safe contracts.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install abstractionkit
```

```typescript
import { SafeAccountV0_3_0 as SafeAccount } from "abstractionkit";

const account = SafeAccount.initializeNewAccount([ownerPublicKey]);
console.log(account.accountAddress); // 0x… deterministic smart wallet address
```

import CardList from "/src/components/CardList";
import Callout from "/src/components/Callout";

export const GETTING_STARTED_ITEMS = [
  {
    title: "Send your First Gasless Transaction",
    description:
      "Create a smart account and submit your first gasless UserOperation with batched transactions",
    route: "/wallet/guides/getting-started",
  },
  {
    title: "Pay Gas in ERC-20",
    description:
      "Let users pay transaction fees in USDC, DAI, or any ERC-20 token",
    route: "/wallet/guides/pay-gas-in-erc20",
  },
  {
    title: "EIP-7702 Account Upgrades",
    description:
      "Upgrade existing EOAs to smart accounts with EIP-7702 delegation",
    route: "/wallet/guides/getting-started-eip-7702",
  },
];

## Why Smart Accounts?

Smart accounts eliminate the biggest UX barriers in Web3:
- **No gas tokens**: Users pay fees in any ERC-20 or have them sponsored entirely
- **Modern onboarding**: Login with passkeys, email, or social accounts. No seed phrases
- **Built-in security**: Account recovery, multisig support, and spending limits
- **Batch transactions**: Execute multiple operations atomically in a single transaction

*Smart accounts are programmable contracts, unlocking capabilities impossible with traditional EOAs.*

## Core Features

### Gas Abstraction
- Gasless transactions: [Sponsor user fees](/wallet/guides/send-gasless-tx/) with flexible rules and policies
- ERC-20 gas payments: Let users [pay gas in any token](/wallet/guides/pay-gas-in-erc20/) (USDC, DAI, etc.)

### Modern Authentication
- Passkey integration: [Onchain WebAuthn](/wallet/plugins/passkeys/) support for biometric login
- Social login: [Email and OAuth](/wallet/guides/authentication/#social--email) integration

### Advanced Transactions
- Batch operations: [Execute multiple transactions](/wallet/guides/getting-started/#step-4-create-useroperation) atomically
- Spending controls: [Set limits and policies](/wallet/plugins/allowance) for subscriptions and recurring payments

### Security
- Account recovery: [Social Recovery](/wallet/plugins/recovery-with-guardians) or [traditional](/wallet/recovery/auth-api/) recovery options
- Multi-signature: A single account controlled with [multiple signatures](/wallet/guides/multisig/)

## Developer Tools
