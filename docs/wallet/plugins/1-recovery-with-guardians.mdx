# Account Recovery

Social Recovery allows users to regain control of their accounts by replacing the owner key through a set of trusted Guardians, with a built-in time delay so owners can cancel unauthorized attempts.

The Candide Social Recovery Module accepts any Ethereum address as a guardian: family and friends' wallets, hardware wallets, institutions, or email/SMS cloud wallets.

## Recovery Methods

Both recovery methods can be used independently or combined. For maximum security, use both. For example, a 2-of-3 setup with two personal guardians and email/SMS recovery as the third.

| | Personal Guardians | Email / SMS Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| **Guardian type** | Users add their own guardians | Candide signs after email/SMS OTP |
| **Key management** | Required (guardian private keys) | Not required |
| **Best for** | Trusted contacts, hardware wallets | Consumer apps, users who prefer email/SMS |
| **Setup guides** | Add Guardian → Recovery Flow → Alerts | Enable Email/SMS → Recovery Flow |
