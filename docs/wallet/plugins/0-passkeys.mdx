Passkeys can be used to secure onchain smart accounts using **fingerprint**, **face recognition**, or the device **PIN** code. Users no longer need to manage and remember complex private keys; instead, they can effortlessly access their digital wallets using passkey-enabled devices, synced across devices via Apple's **iCloud Keychain**, or other cross-platform password managers like **Proton Pass** and **Bitwarden**.

In the context of an Ethereum wallet, **Passkeys** serve as substitutes for traditional seedphrase backups. Unlike the default curve (secp256k1) used for Externally Owned Accounts (EOA), Passkeys generate unique digital keys using the **secp256r1** curve. These keys benefit from device secure enclave cryptography, which enhances security by preventing password reuse. Passkeys are built on the WebAuthn standard, leveraging public-key cryptography. Developed collaboratively by the FIDO Alliance, which includes Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others, Passkeys strictly adhere to WebAuthn standards.

## Safe Passkeys

The Safe Passkeys contracts are developed by the Safe Protocol Team. 

The contracts and its audits are available on the [Safe-Modules repo](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules/tree/main/modules/passkey). 
The deployment addresses can be found in our [Contracts Deployment](/wallet/technical-reference/deployments/#safe-passkeys)
## Demo
 
These example showcases a Safe Smart Account deployment utilizing 4337 and Passkeys, and minting an NFT.

## Create Passkeys Account

<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm i abstractionkit@0.1.16
```

:::note 
We're installing `v0.1.16` of `abstractionkit`, the beta version of the SDK that includes the Safe Passkeys.

We will often import WebAuthn API helper functions and classes from [/webauthn](https://github.com/candidelabs/abstractionkit/blob/experimental/examples/SafeAccountExamples/WebAuthnCreateAccountAndSendTransaction/src/webauthn.ts). Make sure to copy it and using it during your developement.

### Step 1: Create WebAuthn credentials

Create WebAuthn credentials using the navigator.credentials API. This includes defining parameters such as the relying party (RP) name and ID, user details, and challenge.

```ts
import ethers from "ethers";
import { WebAuthnCredentials } from './webauthn';

const navigator = {
    credentials: new WebAuthnCredentials(),
}

const credential = navigator.credentials.create({
    publicKey: {
        rp: {
            name: 'Candide',
            id: 'candide.dev',
        },
        user: {
            id: ethers.getBytes(ethers.id('chucknorris')),
            name: 'chucknorris',
            displayName: 'Chuck Norris',
        },
        challenge: ethers.toBeArray(Date.now()),
        pubKeyCredParams: [{ type: 'public-key', alg: -7 }],
    },
})
```

### Step 2: Extract Public Key

Extract the public key from the generated WebAuthn credential response

```ts
import { extractPublicKey } from "./webauthn";
import { WebauthPublicKey } from "abstractionkit";

const publicKey = extractPublicKey(credential.response)

const webauthPublicKey: WebauthPublicKey = {
    x: publicKey.x,
    y: publicKey.y,
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize Smart Account

Initialize the Safe Smart Account as usual. The `SafeAccountV0_3_0` supports Entrypoint v0.7, while `SafeAccountV0_2_0` supports Entrypoint v0.6.

```ts
import { SafeAccountV0_3_0 as SafeAccount } from "abstractionkit";

const smartAccount = SafeAccount.initializeNewAccount([webauthPublicKey])
```

:::info Combine Signature Types
You can combine an EOA public address and a webauthPublicKey in the initializing function 
to create a multisig secured by both types.
:::

## Create Passkey UserOp
This step follows the same flow as the normal Safe flow with  [createUserOperation](../../abstractionkit/safe-account/#createuseroperation), with the addition of the webauthn dummy signature. 

```ts
import { WebauthDummySignerSignaturePair } from "abstractionkit";

let userOperation = await smartAccount.createUserOperation(
    [transaction] // constructed your MetaTranasction 
    jsonRpcNodeProvider, //The Node rpc endpoint.
    bundlerUrl, //The Bundler rpc endpoint.
    {
        dummySignatures: [WebauthDummySignerSignaturePair]
    },
)
```

## Sign with Passkeys

### Step 1: Calculate the EIP712 hash

Calculate the Safe EIP712 hash for the UserOp

```ts
const safeInitOpHash = SafeAccount.getUserOperationEip712Hash(
    userOperation,
    chainId,
);
```

### Step 2: Request a WebAuthn assertion

Using the navigator.credentials API

```ts
import { UserVerificationRequirement } from "./webauthn";

const assertion = navigator.credentials.get({
    publicKey: {
        challenge: ethers.getBytes(safeInitOpHash),
        rpId: 'candide.dev',
        allowCredentials: [{ type: 'public-key', id: new Uint8Array(credential.rawId) }],
        userVerification: UserVerificationRequirement.required,
    },
})
```

### Step 3: Extract WebAuthn signature data

Extract WebAuthn signature data from the assertion response and create a signature from the extracted signature data

```ts
import { WebauthSignatureData } from "abstractionkit";
import { extractClientDataFields, extractSignature } from "./webauthn";

const webauthSignatureData: WebauthSignatureData = {
    authenticatorData: assertion.response.authenticatorData,
    clientDataFields: extractClientDataFields(assertion.response),
    rs: extractSignature(assertion.response),
}

const webauthSignature: string = SafeAccount.createWebAuthnSignature(webauthSignatureData)
```

### Step 4: Create a Signer Signature Pair and Format

Create a `SignerSignaturePair` containing the `webauthPublicKey` and `webauthSignature`, and format the `SignerSignaturePair` into the expected format for the userOperation signature

```ts
import { SignerSignaturePair } from "abstractionkit";

const signerSignaturePair: SignerSignaturePair = {
    signer: webauthPublicKey,
    signature: webauthSignature,
}

userOperation.signature = SafeAccount.formatSignaturesToUseroperationSignature(
    [signerSignaturePair],
	{ isInit: userOperation.nonce == 0n },
)
```

## Submit the UserOp onchain

```ts
const sendUserOperationResponse = await smartAccount.sendUserOperation(
    userOperation,
    bundlerUrl,
);
const userOperationReceiptResult = await sendUserOperationResponse.included();
```

## Additional Notes

### Saving Public Credentials  
It's crucial to store the Passkey's public credentials, specifically the *x, y, and rawId*, 
in a retrievable location. Losing this data would mean users can't recover their accounts 
with Passkeys. This information isn't sensitive, so you can set up a simple server to do so, 
or you can you use[@simplewebauthn/server](https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/packages/server) for 
this purpose.

### Sync & Recovery

#### Apple
Passkey recovery on Apple devices involves iCloud Keychain escrow. In case of device loss, 
users authenticate through their iCloud account using standard procedure. After authentication, 
they enter their device passcode. Apple users also has the option to add an account recovery contact 
for additional support. Learn more on [Apple Passkeys security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195) 

#### Google

Google Password Manager seamlessly syncs passkeys across devices, with plans to extend syncing
support to a broader range of operating systems. Learn more on [Google Passkeys security](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys)

#### Yubikey
YubiKey is compatible with passkeys through its support for the authentication protocol. 
Passkeys can be protected and managed using YubiKey's hardware-based security features. 
Learn more on [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/blog/a-yubico-faq-about-passkeys/)

#### Password Managers
Passkey backups are not limited to hardware manufactures, they are supported across different 
password managers like [Windows Hello](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-in-windows-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422), 
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/passwordless-passkeys/), [ProtonPass](https://proton.me/blog/proton-pass-passkeys),
[1Password](https://1password.com/product/passkeys), [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/features/passwordless-authentication) and others.  

### Device Support
Passkeys are widely available across devices such as: 
- Apple Devices: iPhones & iPads (iOS 16+), Mac (macOS 13+)
- Android Devices: Phones and tablets (Android 9+)
- Windows (10/11/+): Supported on Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Firefox browsers
